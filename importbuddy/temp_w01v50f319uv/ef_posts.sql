Using an eye tracking methodology is a great way to offer a personal perspective that helps clients better understand their customers and how they interact with brands and stores.\r\n\r\nAt Eye Faster, while we do work directly with stores and manufacturers, we find that offering our capabilities as part of a larger more robust research program allows for a strategic partnership with market research providers and, in turn, a more powerful solution for clients. Our experience has given us unique insight into the shopper’s mind and we would be happy to consult with your company on any in-store methodologies.\r\n\r\nWe have spent over 10 years perfecting our approach to in-store research. Using the most accurate eye tracking equipment from Applied Science Laboratories (ASL), we record the shopper’s perspective as they shop. Using our proprietary analytic software, we analyze the videos to look for similarities in the way shoppers behave while in store. As part of our reporting, we provide customized analytics and heat maps of the store, aisle, and shelves.\r\n\r\nOur findings fit seamlessly into your program reporting and, like any full-service provider, we are happy to workshop with you on creating a cohesive report: identifying key areas for improvement and making sure to point out any unique findings that may improve shopper experience and brand or store performance.\r\n\r\n[call_to_action]Would you like to add our services to your in-store research methodology?[/call_to_action]', 'Market Research', 'Mobile eye tracking is one of the most cutting-edge and innovative ways to better understand how customers interact with retail locations and the products on the shelf.', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '65-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-03-17 22:44:08', '2015-03-17 22:44:08', '', '65', 'http://localhost:8888/65-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

Our unique solutions include shelf tests, signage tests, package testing, aisle layout, in-depth video analysis of shopper behavior, and shopper navigation.\r\n\r\nWith Eye Faster, you get a team of experienced shopper eye-tracking experts working on your in-store studies. Our team has experience running eye tracking projects in over 75 retailers for countless brands and products in over 15 countries.\r\n\r\nOur chosen provider of eye-tracking equipment is ASL because the scope of what we’re able to test is quite remarkable. Once a respondent is wearing ASL’s equipment, we are able to pinpoint exactly what they are looking at and when. The glasses take a video recording that is later processed by our team to uncover similarities in what’s drawing shoppers’ attention.\r\n\r\nASL’s best in class equipment can be used to measure how an individual product is shopped for, using both free shop and findability methodologies. We can also look at how an entire category is shopped: which products are noticed and how that may relate to their shelf placement or signage at the shelf, such as price or sales signs.\r\n\r\nWe can figuratively zoom out and look at the store from a more macro perspective. Is it easy for shoppers to navigate to the aisle section of the store they are looking for? Using the video-recording we create aggregated mapping of a shoppers path in the store, that can tell us a number of things about wayfinding and in-store navigation. We often recommend that we test two or more layouts in certain types of stores so that we can compare which is better in terms of getting the product off the shelf and into a shopper’s cart.\r\n\r\nIn partnering with POPAI in 2013, we used our technology to give a first-hand perspective of how shopper’s shopped in multiple stores among 3 retailers in 6 markets. From this research, we could draw conclusions about similarities between retail locations and uncover unique opportunities to improve the shoppers experience. One of the more interesting findings from this study was that the majority of a shopper’s visit to a store involves unplanned purchasing. However, unplanned purchasing and therefore purchasing in general, sharply declines for the last 20% of a shopper’s trip.\r\n\r\nBoth retailers and manufacturers of consumer goods use our findings to better promote their products in store.

Red Bull, Monster, and Rockstar are consistently the top three brands. Coca Cola has two energy drink brands on offer, NOS and Full Throttle, but both brands have a tiny and declining market share: NOS fell from 3.6 to 3.3 percent from 2010 to 2013, and Full Throttle fell from 2.2 percent to not even registering as a major competitor. This despite massive amounts of advertising dollars—NOS increased ad spending by 187 percent from 2010 to 2012, and Full Throttle outspent Monster and Rockstar combined.\r\n\r\nWhen evaluating packaging personality, consumers give these two products the lowest scores of any energy drink brands. They are not considered cool, fun, or energizing. The only personality trait that both rated positive on was “extreme.” Coca Cola would do better to focus its resources on can design than to continue wasting money on advertising.\r\n\r\nIn a recent package design study for a large carbonated soft drink company, we found that on shelf, shoppers were significantly more drawn to the a new package design (90 percent of shoppers looked for more than 3.0 seconds) versus the current one (76 percent looked for 1.7 seconds). The new package definitely drew more attention, but did this lead to purchase? Yes it did.

Estimates vary, but maybe 10 percent of information ever penetrates the conscious level. A consumer can’t buy something that he or she doesn’t notice, so products must make the move from the subconscious mind to the conscious mind in order to even be considered. It’s only at the consideration point that a product may be converted to a sale.\r\n\r\nThe first step to getting noticed is eye fixation, something we know a little about. The human eye switches between movement and stillness. Our research has found that the movements, which individuals are largely unaware of, last about 20–40 milliseconds (ms), and the still periods last about 100–400 ms. Once fixated, the eye takes in visual information about a 2-degree angle around the fixation location, and everything else is seen in peripheral vision, which is quite coarse.\r\n\r\nTransitioning from the fuzzy mass of information in a shopper’s peripheral vision to become an object of fixation is a challenge for brands. The best way to do this varies by product, but some suggestions include placing the product near eye level (ideally from 30 degrees below eye level to about 10 degrees above eye level), adding standout images, using bright colors and faces, reducing text, and incorporating movement.\r\n\r\nEven a conscious fixation on something does not always mean it’s written into memory or noticed. In an eye-tracking study we conducted in a music store, one subject fixated on items of interest (products and signs) 245 different times in 5 minutes. Another fixated 1,569 different times in 15 minutes. When asked afterwards to recall whether they’d seen specific signs, the subjects rarely remembered those they had looked at—they had seen too many things.\r\n\r\nIn order to reduce the information overload of fixating on so many items, our  subconscious processing narrows our “consideration set”—i.e., the products we notice. Cereal, for example, may be stacked from floor to top shelf down an entire row, but consumers who aren’t buying for kids may completely ignore the bottom shelves. Salad dressings are arranged by brand, each with a distinctly shaped bottle, so consumers will zero in on a familiar-looking group of bottles and ignore everything else.\r\n\r\nThe consideration set can be used to attract attention to other products, especially for private-label items. A private-label product that looks similar to a name-brand product will attract more attention and consideration from consumers than if its packaging were distinct. This is why someone looking for Cheerios is likely to notice the similar yellow box of Toasted Oats, and then he or she may do a price comparison and go for the cheaper option.\r\n\r\nIt’s at this point, when shoppers are considering an item, that they start to use past experiences, feelings about the product or brand, and in-store influences like sales or price to determine if the item is something they want to purchase.  \r\n\r\nWhether you’re launching a new product or trying to increase sales of your current product, understanding how consumers’ brains process visual information is critical to your success.

The problem here  is not that supermarkets are being careless. They know exactly what they’re doing: keeping the customers happy.\r\n\r\nAs shopper insight experts and shoppers ourselves, we know that when customers walk into a grocery store, they expect to see perfection; no bruised produce, no depleted deli cases, and no dented cans. Everything should be pleasing to the eye, plentiful, and nothing should be flawed. In order to meet these high aesthetic expectations, supermarkets and the people who run them end up throwing away vast amounts of perfectly edible food.\r\n\r\nThe produce aisle is an excellent example. Shoppers don’t want to see a bin with even a few soft, bruised apples sitting on the bottom; they want to see a towering stack of crunchy, shiny apples. Grocery managers routinely order more apples than they expect to sell and throw them out as soon as they show any signs of softening or bruising Consumer value on the look of their fresh produce contributes to 13 billion pounds of losses in fruits and vegetables annually.\r\n\r\nThe deli is another area of a grocery store that suffers a lot of food loss due to overstocking. Nielsen has identified “assembling” meals instead of preparing meals as a major consumer trend. While people are making fewer trips to the grocery store overall (56 average trips in 2012, compared with 72 in 2001), convenience food sales were up, in some case by double digits, just between 2013 and 2014. But keeping the deli case and nearby displays of freshly packaged meals stocked comes at a cost.\r\n\r\nA paper by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) explains that while some of the loss can be offset by using meat and produce that are nearing their expiration date, keeping the ready-made food fully stocked through the end of the night results in large amounts of food being tossed out after closing. One grocer estimated that half of his rotisserie chickens were thrown away every night.\r\n\r\nFood loss is not limited to fresh foods, though. Damaged packaging—such as dented cans—makes food unsellable. While the food inside may still be safe to eat, consumers won’t buy these items for fear of rot or botulism, and stores wisely remove them from the shelf.\r\n\r\nPackaged foods are also wasted because of “sell by” dates. However, we know that these dates are simply meant tell you how long to display items on shelves, and that they have little to do with food safety and are not mandated by federal law. But consumers confuse “sell by” dates with “use by” dates, thinking that food is expired long before it really is. Many stores even get rid of food a few days before the “sell by” date to appease these squeamish buyers. The NRDC reports that supermarkets lose an estimated $2,300 per day on out-of-date foods.\r\n\r\nFor those in the grocery industry, these types of food waste are just part of a daily reality. No one would argue there isn’t value in consumer opinion, and a radical shift in consumer demand seems unlikely. However, there are steps that can be taken to reduce loss.\r\n\r\nWould customers buy those less-than-perfect items if they got a great deal? Some stores have begun offering discounts on about-to-expire produce and packaged items. The Berkeley Bowl, a local market in Berkeley, California, offers a shelf of $0.99 items that are close to expiration. The market reports selling $1,500 per day from this shelf.\r\n\r\nComposting food waste could be an effective way to go “green” and save some green along the way. New Seasons Markets, which operates 12 stores in the Pacific Northwest, started composting in 2006. The grocery chain has diverted over 2,410 tons from landfills and saved nearly $27,000 in waste expenses by doing so.\r\n\r\nGiving back to those in need—which may also help boost employee morale—can be achieved by donating still-edible items to a local food bank. SUPERVALU, Inc., which owns brands including Albertsons and Stop ’n Save, has donated the equivalent of 48 million meals since 2010 and saved $2.6 million in doing so.\r\n\r\nCheck out the EPA’s Food Recovery Challenge for more ideas about reducing waste, as well as resources to help implement new strategies.

INSERT INTO `ef_posts` VALUES('178', '1', '2015-04-03 22:08:48', '2015-04-03 22:08:48', '<strong>Background &mdash;</strong> A national chain of grocery stores asked Eye Faster to review shopper attention and behavior while approaching, waiting in line, and finishing their shopping trip at the check out. General industry assumptions are that most checkout purchases are impulse driven. Qualitatively, we know shoppers do appreciate having a variety of checkout options (self, express, family), and the ability to speed through checkout. Some appreciate the “reminder” function of the items stocked in the checkout area, and some say they like having magazines to flip through while they wait. Positive checkout area experiences include clean belts and friendly or helpful cashiers. Negative experiences include long wait times, crowded spaces, and poor lighting.\r\n\r\n<strong>Approach &mdash;</strong> Shoppers were recruited as they entered the store and offered a gift card to the store as incentive. Using Applied Science Laboratory’s Eye Tracking equipment, shoppers were asked to shop the grocery store and complete their normal or regular shopping trip through checkout.\r\n\r\n<strong>In analyzing the data, Eye Faster divided the checkout experience into seven parts:</strong>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Navigating to Checkout &mdash;</strong> This is the phase where the shopper has completed shopping and is deciding which checkstand to approach</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Waiting to Unload Cart &mdash;</strong> This is the phase where the shopper has selected a checkout line but is waiting to unload</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Unloading Cart &mdash;</strong> Unloading the cart begins when the shopper starts unloading the cart and ends when all the items have been placed on the belt</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Waiting for their Turn &mdash;</strong> This is the phase between finishing unloading the shopping cart and when the cashier starts to process the shopper’s groceries</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Waiting to Start Paying &mdash;</strong> This is the phase between when the cashier starts scanning the shopper’s groceries and the time they begin a payment activity, usually the pin pad</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Paying &mdash;</strong> Paying begins from the time the shopper begins either using the pin pad or providing the cashier with a form of payment until the payment process is done. It does not include the time waiting for the receipt</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Waiting for Completion &mdash;</strong> Shopper’s part of payment has been made and the shopper is now either waiting for bagging to be complete or waiting for their receipt</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nData was analyzed to assess the purchase behavior and attention behavior during these phases.\r\n\r\n<strong>Outcome &mdash;</strong> Shoppers spend, on average, just under six minutes at checkout -- accounting for 16% of the time during their entire shopping experience. While at checkout, shoppers spend about half that time waiting as opposed to an action like navigating, unloading or paying. One of the most obvious findings is that impulse purchasing occurs regularly during the checkout process, especially during the waiting times. During the study, 11% of shoppers made an impulse purchase at the checkout, and most items were purchased while waiting their turn.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ef.zendentest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bev_packaging_fig-1.1.jpg\" alt=\"bev_packaging_fig-1.1\" width=\"700\" height=\"242\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-242\" />\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of these purchases were items most often found at checkout like candy, gum, snacks or a beverage. Magazines received significant attention (viewed by nearly 75% of shoppers), considerable interaction (8% of shoppers touching or holding), yet all that only lead to one purchase. It should be noted that checkout purchases were less than 1% percent of overall purchases made in the store. We recommended that the grocery store use the bottom three shelves of the endcaps, currently housing magazines, to place product that could translate more easily into an impulse purchase, especially pantry items that most households use regularly, as it may act a reminder that they need the item.\r\n\r\nWhile checking out, 25% shoppers encountered an interruption to their checkout process. Most often, these interruptions occured during the payment stage of checking out with 8% of all respondents encountering some interruption during payment.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ef.zendentest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bev_packaging_fig-1.2.jpg\" alt=\"bev_packaging_fig-1.2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-232\" />\r\n\r\nAbout one quarter of these interruptions lead to the customer waiting for over 1 minute for the interruption to be resolved. As there was generally a line at the checkout, these interruptions regularly affected more than one shopper. As part of our recommendation to the grocery store, we recommended that cashiers have scan codes for all items weighing over 15 pounds to minimize the interruption that occurs when a heavy item is purchased. Also, there are a number of interruptions that can be planned for and should have standard protocol in place to resolve like: getting tobacco products for shoppers, providing assistance out of the store when offered, assistance with finding or replacing a product, and price checks.

Our unique solutions include shelf tests, signage tests, package testing, aisle layout, in-depth video analysis of shopper behavior, and shopper navigation.\r\n\r\nWith Eye Faster, you get a team of experienced shopper eye-tracking experts working on your in-store studies. Our team has experience running eye tracking projects in over 75 retailers for countless brands and products in over 15 countries.\r\n\r\nOur chosen provider of eye-tracking equipment is ASL because the scope of what we’re able to test is quite remarkable. Once a respondent is wearing ASL’s equipment, we are able to pinpoint exactly what they are looking at and when. The glasses take a video recording that is later processed by our team to uncover similarities in what’s drawing shoppers’ attention.\r\n\r\nASL’s best in class equipment can be used to measure how an individual product is shopped for, using both free shop and findability methodologies. We can also look at how an entire category is shopped: which products are noticed and how that may relate to their shelf placement or signage at the shelf, such as price or sales signs.\r\n\r\nWe can figuratively zoom out and look at the store from a more macro perspective. Is it easy for shoppers to navigate to the aisle section of the store they are looking for? Using the video-recording we create aggregated mapping of a shoppers path in the store, that can tell us a number of things about wayfinding and in-store navigation. We often recommend that we test two or more layouts in certain types of stores so that we can compare which is better in terms of getting the product off the shelf and into a shopper’s cart.\r\n\r\nIn partnering with POPAI in 2013, we used our technology to give a first-hand perspective of how shopper’s shopped in multiple stores among 3 retailers in 6 markets. From this research, we could draw conclusions about similarities between retail locations and uncover unique opportunities to improve the shoppers experience. One of the more interesting findings from this study was that the majority of a shopper’s visit to a store involves unplanned purchasing. However, unplanned purchasing and therefore purchasing in general, sharply declines for the last 20% of a shopper’s trip.\r\n\r\nBoth retailers and manufacturers of consumer goods use our findings to better promote their products in store.

While at checkout, shoppers spend about half that time waiting as opposed to an action like navigating, unloading or paying. One of the most obvious findings is that impulse purchasing occurs regularly during the checkout process, especially during the waiting times. During the study, 11% of shoppers made an impulse purchase at the checkout, and most items were purchased while waiting their turn.\n\n<img src=\"http://ef.zendentest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bev_packaging_fig-1.1.jpg\" alt=\"bev_packaging_fig-1.1\" width=\"700\" height=\"242\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-242\" />\n\nThe vast majority of these purchases were items most often found at checkout like candy, gum, snacks or a beverage.

It should be noted that checkout purchases were less than 1% percent of overall purchases made in the store. We recommended that the grocery store use the bottom three shelves of the endcaps, currently housing magazines, to place product that could translate more easily into an impulse purchase, especially pantry items that most households use regularly, as it may act a reminder that they need the item.\n\nWhile checking out, 25% shoppers encountered an interruption to their checkout process.

As there was generally a line at the checkout, these interruptions regularly affected more than one shopper. As part of our recommendation to the grocery store, we recommended that cashiers have scan codes for all items weighing over 15 pounds to minimize the interruption that occurs when a heavy item is purchased. Also, there are a number of interruptions that can be planned for and should have standard protocol in place to resolve like: getting tobacco products for shoppers, providing assistance out of the store when offered, assistance with finding or replacing a product, and price checks.
